# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Adjusting the application to use "answer" instead of "reading" in the dataset.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Updated the header of `public/dataset.csv`.

**Next Steps:**

*   Identify and modify functions that use the "reading" column.
*   Ensure the application functions correctly with the new "answer" column.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to best identify the functions that need to be updated.
*   How to ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions.
